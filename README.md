Install
-------

`npm install apper`


Idea
----

The core idea of `apper` is to enable easy REST api based node.js apps, by
letting you place individual subapps simply in the required directory hierarchy.

Moving a subapp directory just changes its relative URL from the base app.


### Example directory structure

  - *root/*
    - **server.js**: *see _Usage_ section below*
    - **routes.js**: GET /list
    - *public/*
      - **index.html**

    - *subapp/*
      - **routes.js**: GET /, POST /

      - *subsubapp/*
        - **middleware.js**
        - **routes.js**: GET /, GET /last


### API exposed by the directory structure above

* GET  /        _(serves index.html)_
* GET  /list

* GET  /subapp
* POST /subapp

* GET  /subapp/subsubapp
* GET  /subapp/subsubapp/last


Concepts
---------

### What makes an app?

A regular folder becomes a valid app if it has one of the following:

* An environment settings module with the name `environment.js`
  (can be changed by options passed or `moduleNames.environment` property in `apper.json`)
* A middleware module with the name `middleware.js`
  (can be changed by options passed or `moduleNames.middleware` property in `apper.json`)
* A static content folder with the name `public`
  (can be changed by options passed or `staticContentPath` property in `apper.json`)
* A routes module with the name `routes.js`
  (can be changed by options passed or `moduleNames.routes` property in `apper.json`)

#### Order of initialization of above-mentioned modules

The following things get initialized on the subapp in order:

* Environment module gets loaded to set environment settings using `app.set` 
* Middleware module gets loaded to setup middleware functions using `app.use`
* Static content folder gets exposed on subapp's url
  (the folder hierarchy containing the subapp)
* Routes get loaded that respond to paths _other_ than those found in static
  content.


### Bigger apps composed of small apps

The root app can contain sub-directories which are complete apps unto themselves. 
These directories become subapps of the root app.

Subapps can be pulled out and placed anywhere in the overall directory structure.
This would make them available on the new relative url with respect to the root.

Every subapp folder can be started as a separated app by including `server.js` in there.

Due to the directory hierarchy based mounting of subapps, the base URL paths of
all subapps are decided by their position in the directory hierarchy.

The subapps can then register for any relative URL route after their base URL and
handle requests accordingly.


Usage
-----

### server.js

    var app = require("apper")();

    app.init() && app.start();

It automatically starts a WebSocket server using `socket.io`
which can be used on the client by including `/socket.io/socket.io.js` in HTML.

You may want to include `server.js` in subapps as well, just to be able to go
into that directory and start that subapp as the root app.


### Structure of modules

Get an Express-based app object and run express methods like 
`app.set`, `app.use`, `app.get`, `app.post`, etc. on it.

#### environment.js

    module.exports = function (app) {
        app.set("property", "value");
    }

#### middleware.js

    module.exports = function (app) {
        app.use(function (req, res, next) {
            next();
        });
    }

#### routes.js

    module.exports = function (app) {
        app.get("/", function (req, res) {
            res.send("hey");
        });
    }


Configuration
-------------

`apper.json` placed in root or any subapp directory controls the following
configuration for the respective app:
* `moduleNames`
  * `environment`
    Environment module file name for the current app (omit `.js`)
  * `middleware`
    Middleware module file name for the current app (omit `.js`)
  * `routes`
    Routes module file name for the current app (omit `.js`)
* `staticContentPath`
  Static content directory name for the current app
* `dirToIgnore`
  List of directories to not consider as subapps in the current app's directory


Tests
-----

Install `mocha`

    npm install -g mocha

In the project directory, run

    mocha
