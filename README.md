Install
-------

For usage as command-line tool:

```bash
$ npm install -g apper
```

For usage in code:

```bash
$ npm install apper
```

Motivation
----------

[Express] [5] isn't enough. It lacks structure and conventions.

Apper provides:

- Much needed **structure** to server-side code with strong conventions
- Reliable **directory hierarchy** for code based on REST end-points
- Design for **real-time** right off the bat
- Transparent **minification & bundling** for single page apps

The core idea of `apper` is to enable easy REST api based node.js apps, especially 
useful for Single Page Applications.

Apper lets you create bigger apps by using smaller independent chunks as subapps.
Simply place individual subapps anywhere in the directory hierarchy, and they get
exposed under a relative base URL.

Nested subapps are totally cool and highly encouraged.
In fact, simply by moving a subapp directory to another directory updates the exposed 
relative URL of that subapp. No frills.


### Example directory structure

- root/
    - **server.js**: See *Usage* section below
    - **routes.js**: GET /list
    - **public/**
        - *index.html*
        - *main.js*

- **subapp/**
    - *routes.js*: GET /, POST /

    - **subsubapp/**
        - *middleware.js*
        - *routes.js*: GET /, GET /last

Marked *routes.js* files are supposed to specify route handlers for paths mentioned
against them.


### API exposed by the directory structure above

    GET  /
    GET  /list
    
    GET  /subapp
    POST /subapp
    
    GET  /subapp/subsubapp
    GET  /subapp/subsubapp/last

The route `/` serves `index.html` in `public/` by default.


Concepts
---------

### What makes an app?

A regular directory becomes a valid app if it has one or more of the following:

* An environment settings module with the name `environment.js`
* A middleware module with the name `middleware.js`
* A socket subscription module with the name `sockets.js`
* A static content directory with the name `public`
* A routes module with the name `routes.js`

All of the default file/directory names above can be changed by options in 
`apper.json` file in any directory.


#### Order of initialization of above-mentioned modules

The following things get initialized on the subapp in order:

* Environment module gets loaded to set environment settings using `app.set` (like Express)
* Middleware module gets loaded to setup middleware functions using `app.use` (like Express)
* Sockets module gets loaded to setup WebSocket subscriptions between server and client 
* Static content directory gets exposed on subapp's url
  (the directory hierarchy containing the subapp)
* Routes get loaded that respond to URL end-points (using `app.get`, `app.post`, etc.)


### Bigger apps composed of small apps

The root app can contain sub-directories which are complete apps unto themselves. 
These directories become subapps of the root app.

Subapps can be pulled out and placed anywhere in the overall directory structure.
This would make them available on the new relative url with respect to the root.

Every subapp directory can be started as a separated app just by running `apper` in there.

Due to the directory hierarchy based mounting of subapps, the base URL paths of
all subapps are decided by their position in the directory hierarchy.

The subapps can then register for any relative URL route after their base URL and
handle requests accordingly.


Usage
-----

### From command-line

Just open the command prompt in a directory with server-side code as described below, and run:

```bash
$ apper --port 8000 --address 0.0.0.0 ./src
```
    
Here, `./src` is the root path of the application code.
It defaults to the current directory from which `apper` is run.

Port and address are optional and default to shown values.

To display internal logs while working, just prepend `DEBUG=apper:*` to the command, like this:

```bash
$ DEBUG=apper:* apper --port 8000
```


### As a module

Create a file (say, `server.js`) in your application directory

```js
var app = require('apper')({
    port: 8000
});
app.start();
```

Then, running `server.js` will start the application on port 8000. For example:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

To see internal logs (helpful during development), just set the environment variable `DEBUG` as follows:

```bash
$ DEBUG=apper:* node server.js
```

For more ways to use `DEBUG`, see [Debug Module on NPM] [9]


### As Express application

Create an application object as usual, and use `app.expressApp` as a regular express application

```js
var app = require('apper')(),
    expressApp = app.expressApp;

// Now `expressApp` is a regular Express application with all the features of your **apper** application
expressApp.listen(5000);
```

You can mount this application to a base URL in your regular express app as follows:

```js
var app = require('apper')();
MyRootApp.use('/blog', app);
```

Now __/blog__  route will invoke the **apper** application.


Startup Options
---------------

It automatically loads the modules mentioned above and starts a server.

You could provide options like:

```js
var app = require('apper')({
    path: '.',
    port: 8000,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    
    // Not commonly used. Just use `apper.json` for the configuration
    toOpenBrowser: false,
    staticContentName: 'public',
    moduleNames: {
        environment: 'environment'
        middleware: 'middleware',
        routes: 'routes',
        sockets: 'sockets'
    },
    mountPath: ''
});
app.start();
```

The default values for the options (path/port/etc) are as shown above.
The options mean the following:

- `path`: Path for the directory to be taken as the root application.
- `port`: Port number on which to expose the application.
- `host`: Host name to be used for the application (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `0.0.0.0`, etc).
- `toOpenBrowser`: Whether to open the system default browser with the created application.
- `staticContentName`: AheName of the static content directory inside the application directory.
- `moduleNames.*`: As discussed below in Structure of Modules.
- `mountPath`: Base URL to mount this application on, if so needed. Used internally for mounting subapps.

Server automatically starts a socket.io WebSocket server which clients can connect to by including
`<script src='/socket.io/socket.io.js'></script>` in client-side code.


### Structure of modules

Get an Express-based app object and run express methods like 
`app.set`, `app.use`, `app.get`, `app.post`, etc. on it.

For WebSocket requests, `app.sockets` provides the same functionality as
`io.sockets` using [socket.io] [6]

#### environment.js

```js
module.exports = function (app) {
    app.set('property', 'value');
    // Environment configuration
};
```

#### middleware.js

```js
module.exports = function (app) {
    
    app.use(function (req, res, next) {
        // middleware code
        next();
    });
};
```
    
#### sockets.js

```js
module.exports = function (app) {
    app.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
        
        socket.on('hey', function (name) {
            socket.emit('Hey ' + name + '!');
        });
        
    }
};
```

#### routes.js

```js
module.exports = function (app) {
    
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('hey');
    });
};
```


Configuration
-------------

`apper.json` placed in root or any subapp directory controls the following
configuration for the respective app:

* `moduleNames.environment` (Example: _'env'_)
  
  Environment module file name for the current app

* `moduleNames.middleware` (Example: _'mid'_)
  
  Middleware module file name for the current app

* `moduleNames.sockets` (Example: _'sock'_)
  
  Socket subscriptions module for the current app

* `moduleNames.routes` (Example: _'route-definitions'_)
  
  Routes module file name for the current app

* `staticContentPath` (Example: _'www'_)
  
  Static content directory name for the current app.

* `dirToIgnore` (Example: _['subapp', 'another']_)
  
  List of directories to not consider as subapps in the current app's directory.

* `bundle` (Example: _true_/_false_)
  
  Whether to transparently minify and inline all JavaScript and CSS resources, 
  including RequireJS modules. Cached on first use, and served as is thereon.
  
  You can include `require-config.js` in RequireJS `baseUrl` directory to specify
  custom RequireJS options for bundling. Usually not required.


### Sample `apper.json` configuration file

```
{
    "moduleNames: {
        "environment": "env",
        "middleware": "mid",
        "sockets": "sock",
        "routes": "route-definitions"
    },
    "staticContentPath": "www",
    "dirToIgnore": ["subapp", "another"],
    "bundle": true
}
```


Tests
-----

To run tests yourself, install `mocha`

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g mocha
```

In the project directory, run

```bash
$ npm test
```

Check out the `test` directory for usage examples.
